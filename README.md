Heyo! From my bio, I'm an aspiring programmer using Bash scripting and C# as my main languages.

The main projects that I work on are:
- [my Bash Scripting Utility](https://github.com/0xBooper/BashScriptingUtility)
- [my Website](https://github.com/0xBooper/0xBooper.github.io)

Speaking of my website, it's [here](https://0xBooper.github.io/index.html). I also plan to get it a custom domain, maybe like epikbooperia.net.

A few of my github stats:
